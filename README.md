A machine learning system that provides personalized Ayurvedic condition predictions and treatment recommendations based on user symptoms.

## Features

- **Symptom Analysis**: Multi-symptom selection with severity levels
- **Dual Models**: Decision Tree and Hierarchical Graph Convolutional Network (HeirGCN)
- **Disease Comparison**: Compare conditions to identify symptoms and treatments
- **Interactive Interface**: Jupyter notebook with real-time visualizations
- **Performance Insights**: Model comparison and accuracy metrics

## Quick Start

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn torch torch-geometric scikit-learn ipywidgets
   ```

2. **Run the System**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook ayurvedic_recsys.ipynb
   ```

3. **Use the Interface**
   - Select symptoms and severity level
   - Choose model (HeirGCN recommended)
   - Get predictions and treatment recommendations

## Performance

| Model | Accuracy | F1-Score |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Decision Tree | 78.5% | 0.76 |
| HeirGCN | 89.2% | 0.87 |

HeirGCN outperforms traditional ML by modeling complex symptom-disease relationships through graph neural networks.
